SOLID stands for 5 important design principles for Object Oriented Programming
(OOP). These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in
a paper Design Principles and Design Patterns in 2000. The actual SOLID
acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers. The intention of
these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to
maintain and easier to extend. As a software engineer, these 5 principles are
essential to know!

## S — Single responsibility principle
In programming, the Single Responsibility Principle states that every module
or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality
provided by the software. You may have heard the quote: “Do one thing and do
it well”. This refers to the single responsibility principle. In the article
Principles of Object Oriented Design, Robert C. Martin defines a
responsibility as a ‘reason to change’, and concludes that a class or module
should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.

## O — Open/closed principle
In programming, the open/closed principle states that software entities
(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extensions, but closed
for modification. If you have a general understanding of OOP, you probably
already know about polymorphism. We can make sure that our code is compliant
with the open/closed principle by utilizing inheritance and/or implementing
interfaces that enable classes to polymorphically substitute for each other.

## L — Liskov substitution principle
This one is probably the hardest one to wrap your head around when being
introduced for the first time. In programming, the Liskov substitution
principle states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be
replaced (or substituted) with objects of type S. This can be formulated
mathematically as

- Let ϕ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T.

- Then ϕ(y) should be true for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T.

More generally it states that objects in a program should be replaceable with
instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## I — Interface segregation principle
This principle is fairly easy to comprehend. In fact, if you’re used to using
interfaces, chances are that you’re already applying this principle. If not,
it’s time to start doing it! In programming, the interface segregation
principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does
not use. Put more simply: Do not add additional functionality to an existing
interface by adding new methods. Instead, create a new interface and let your
class implement multiple interfaces if needed.

## D - Dependency inversion principle
In programming, the dependency inversion principle is a way to decouple
software modules. This principle states that

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.

- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

To comply with this principle, we need to use a design pattern known as a
dependency inversion pattern, most often solved by using dependency injection.
Dependency injection is a huge topic and can be as complicated or simple as
one might see the need for. Typically, dependency injection is used simply by
‘injecting’ any dependencies of a class through the class’ constructor as an
input parameter.

## By applying these 5 principles that make the SOLID acronym, we get to
benefit from a reusable, maintainable, scalable and easy testable codebase.
